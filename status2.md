#Status Report 1
##What we did
*Updated recipe by url, added user recipe endpoint
*Actually merged scraping
*Bootstrap login page
##Challenges/Issues
* Catching each other up with different technologies so that everyone can understand the components (same as last week)
* Actually being able to meet/work together because our schedules were rather incompatible this week (same as last week)
* Multiple tests and projects in most classes because the semester is wrapping up.

##Goals for next week
* Have a rough login/register page
* Have a rough recipe lookup page
* Have a page to display a given recipe (in print format)
